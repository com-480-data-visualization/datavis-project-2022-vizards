Music is present everywhere, and probably you are listening to it now. It is a part of our culture and society. By this connection, how are musical trends related to major social events? By analyzing the chart trends and popular songs of the past 22 years, we want to explore if there is a significant change in trending music linked or correlated to social movements, for example, on Google Trends or trending Twitter hashtags. The project aims to investigate whether there is a correlation or connection between social trends or changes and successful songs.
