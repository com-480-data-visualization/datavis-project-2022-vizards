                <h1>22 years of music and society</h1>

                <p>Music is present everywhere, and probably you are listening to it now. It is a
                    part of our culture and society. By this connection, how are musical trends related to major social
                    events? By analyzing the chart trends and popular songs of the past 22 years, we want to explore if
                    there is a significant change in trending music linked or correlated to social movements, for
                    example, on Google Trends or trending Twitter hashtags. The project aims to investigate whether
                    there is a correlation or connection between social trends or changes and successful songs.</p>
                <h3>The Plan</h3>
                <p>For the final website, we want to have three parts, where we analyze our data and visualize it. The
                    first part is about the billboard dataset, we want analyze the most successful songs, genres and
                    artists and show insights for example which collaboration are the most successful. After we get
                    quantitative insights, we will examine the qualitative insights, such as lyrics, song build and
                    instrumentals. In the last part we will bring this all together by filtering out the trends and
                    correlate them to social events.</p>
                <h3>First Visualizations</h3>
                In the following you can find the first scathes of our visualizations. Please not that they are scathes
                and out first implementation, so not perfect yet 🥸.
