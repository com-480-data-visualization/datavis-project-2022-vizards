                <h1>22 years of music and society</h1>

                <p>Music is present everywhere, and probably you are listening to it now. It is a
                    part of our culture and society. By this connection, how are musical trends related to major social
                    events? By analyzing the chart trends and popular songs of the past 22 years, we want to explore if
                    there is a significant change in trending music linked or correlated to social movements, for
                    example, on Google Trends or trending Twitter hashtags. The project aims to investigate whether
                    there is a correlation or connection between social trends or changes and successful songs.</p>
                <h3>The Plan</h3>
                <p>To organize our project, we broke down our goal into subtasks to achieve it. These subtasks are  </p> 
                    <ul style="margin-top: -16px;">
                        <li><span class="italic">Genre, and Artists</span>: Our data reveals interesting trends, such as the most successful artists or songs. But also how, for example, the popular genres have changed in the last 22 years. The ingredient is taking the mass of data, finding exciting correlations, and visualizing them. In this part, we delve into the existing dataset and analyze the relationship between the main variables (genre, artists and songs) and the collaboration network.</li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="italic">Lyrics and Further Insights</span>: The lyrics are essential for songs besides the beat. This part will look at song lyrics and other qualitative characteristics such as "danceability" or "energy". Haven't you always wondered whether it's easier to dance to Kanye's or Taylor's songs? Don't worry, and we'll answer the question in this milestone 😉. 
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="italic">Social Context</span>: As stated, we want to analyze the change in the music with the link to social changes and events. We want to merge the other two parts with the social and historical events in this step.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>In the following, we will deal with the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data set. Based on the other two analyses mentioned above, the last component will be dealt with in the final milestone. These two analyses help limit downtime periods and topics to solve the final part.</p>
          
                <h3>First Visualizations</h3>
                In the following you can find the first scathes of our visualizations. Please not that they are scathes
                and out first implementation, so not perfect yet 🥸. Please find further information in our <a href="https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/datavis-project-2022-vizards/blob/main/milestones/milestone2.md"><span class="bold">report</span></a>.
