# Technical Instructions

To run the project, you need a webserver running in this directory, because we are requesting third party libraries hosted by CDN providers. For the live server you have multiple options.

- [VSCode Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- `python3 -m http.server`
- â€¦ (your favorite server)

We are using simple HTML, CSS and JS, so everything should work out of the box without modifying anything.
